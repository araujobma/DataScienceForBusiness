### Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r Scatterplots}
library(ggplot2)
pf <- read.delim('pseudo_facebook.tsv')
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_point()
```

***

#### What are some things that you notice right away?
Response:

***

### ggplot Syntax
Notes:

```{r ggplot Syntax}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(13, 90)

```

***

### Overplotting
Notes:

```{r Overplotting}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/20) +
  xlim(13, 90)

```

#### What do you notice in the plot?
Response:

***

### Coord_trans()
Notes:

```{r Coord_trans()}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/20, position = position_jitter(h = 0)) + 
  xlim(13, 90) +
  coord_trans(x = 'identity', y = "sqrt")
```

#### Look up the documentation for coord_trans() and add a layer to the plot that transforms friend_count using the square root function. Create your plot!

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friendships_initiated), data = pf) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10, position = position_jitter(h = 0)) + 
  xlim(13, 90) +
  coord_trans(x = 'identity', y = "sqrt")
```

#### What do you notice?

***

### Alpha and Jitter
Notes:

```{r Alpha and Jitter}

```

***

### Overplotting and Domain Knowledge
Notes:

***

### Conditional Means
Notes:

```{r Conditional Means}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

age_groups <- group_by(pf, age)
pf.fc_by_age <- summarise(age_groups,
          friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count),
          friend_count_median = median(friend_count),
          n = n())
pf.fc_by_age <- arrange(pf.fc_by_age, age)
head(pf.fc_by_age)
```


```{r}

pf.fc_by_age <- pf %>% 
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count),
          friend_count_median = median(friend_count),
          n = n()) %>%
  arrange(age)

head(pf.fc_by_age)
```



Create your plot!

```{r Conditional Means Plot}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count_mean), data = pf.fc_by_age) +
  geom_line() +
  xlim(13, 90)

```

***

### Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data
Notes:

```{r Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = pf) +
  coord_trans(x = 'identity', y = "sqrt")+
  geom_point(alpha = 1/20, position = position_jitter(h = 0),
             color = 'orange') + 
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = mean) +
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = quantile, fun.args = list(probs = .1),
            linetype = 2, color = 'blue') +
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = quantile, fun.args = list(probs = .5),
            color = 'blue') +
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = quantile, fun.args = list(probs = .9),
            linetype = 2, color = 'blue') +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(13, 90), ylim = c(0, 1000))

```

#### What are some of your observations of the plot?
Response:

***

### Moira: Histogram Summary and Scatterplot
See the Instructor Notes of this video to download Moira's paper on perceived audience size and to see the final plot.

Notes:

***

### Correlation
Notes:

```{r Correlation}
cor.test(pf$age, pf$friend_count)
```

Look up the documentation for the cor.test function.

What's the correlation between age and friend count? Round to three decimal places.
Response:

***

### Correlation on Subsets
Notes:

```{r Correlation on Subsets}

with(subset(pf, age <= 70), cor.test(age, friend_count))
```

***

### Correlation Methods
Notes:

***

## Create Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = www_likes_received, y = likes_received), data = pf) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) + 
  coord_trans(x = 'identity', y = "identity") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10000), ylim = c(0, 10000))
```

***

### Strong Correlations
Notes:

```{r Strong Correlations}
ggplot(aes(x = www_likes_received, y = likes_received), data = pf) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlim( 0, quantile(pf$www_likes_received, 0.95) ) +
  ylim( 0, quantile(pf$likes_received, 0.95) ) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'red')


```

What's the correlation betwen the two variables? Include the top 5% of values for the variable in the calculation and round to 3 decimal places.

```{r Correlation Calcuation}
cor.test(pf$www_likes_received, pf$likes_received)
```

Response:

***

### Moira on Correlation
Notes:

***

### More Caution with Correlation
Notes:

```{r More Caution With Correlation}
install.packages('alr3')
library(alr3)
data("Mitchell")
?Mitchell
```

Create your plot!

```{r Temp vs Month}
ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = Temp), data = Mitchell) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,35))
```

***

### Noisy Scatterplots
a. Take a guess for the correlation coefficient for the scatterplot. A: 0

b. What is the actual correlation of the two variables?
(Round to the thousandths place)

```{r Noisy Scatterplots}
cor.test(Mitchell$Month, Mitchell$Temp)
  #with(subset(Mitchell, Month > 6 & Month <= 12), cor.test(Month, Temp))
```
